= Introduction

This repository is a collection of resources for installing linux on PowerPC based routerboards (RB333,RB600,RB800).
Unfortunatly I only own an RB600 as such that is my only test bed.


= Partitioning

RouterBOOT when setup to boot it will try to load a kernel by executing the partition with type 0x27 as a kernel image.
There does not seem to be a way to use initrd, as such some modules must be build in to the kernel image.
Also kernel must not be above a certain size or it will not boot. (4MB uncompressed??)

= Debian 8/9 Initial Setup

sudo debootstrap --foreign --arch powerpc stretch chroot/ http://httpredir.debian.org/debian/
sudo echo "/dev/sda2 / ext4 defaults 0 0" > chroot/etc/fstab
sudo echo "<device-fqdn>" > /etc/hostname
sudo cat >> /etc/network/interfaces  <<EOF
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
EOF
sudo cp -a <modules_dir> chroot/lib/ 


And on the device boot with `init=/bin/sh` as a kernel parameter for the first time and do the following:

mount -o remount,rw /
LC_ALL=C LANGUAGE=C LANG=C /debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage


Set networking up 
ifup eth0
apt-get update
apt-get install locales openssh-server bash-completion
